## Packages
framer-motion | Essential for drag-and-drop interactions and smooth transitions
react-use | Useful hooks for measurements and intervals (optional but helpful, standard hooks work too)

## Notes
- Images for panels are generated asynchronously. The frontend needs to handle 'pending', 'generating', 'completed', and 'failed' states.
- Speech bubbles require drag-and-drop. We will use `framer-motion`'s `drag` capability.
- Fonts: Using 'Bangers' for headers and 'Architects Daughter' for handwritten text to match the comic aesthetic.
